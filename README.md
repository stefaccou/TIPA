# TIPA: Typologically Informed Parameter Aggregation

TIPA is a package for typologically informed parameter aggregation.
It provides tools to combine any number of architecturally identical modules, with a customisable weighting function.
We also provide a weighting function based on typological distance between a source and target language for zero-shot cross-lingual transfer.

For more info, we refer to notebook "0_Method_implementation.ipynb" in the repository,
or to our paper [TBD].

The files for creating the task adapters or English-language finetunings can be found in directory adapters_finetunings.


## Usage

```zsh
pip install git+https://github.com/stefaccou/TIPA
```
